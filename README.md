##Resources

I used a few resources for this homework assignment that allowed me to learn different ways to use event listeners.

- "Listener" Branch Counter
	
For this part of the assignment, I used the following [W3School Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_function_counter3). This tutorial taught me how to add counting functionality.

- "Custom" Branch Listeners

For this part of the assignment, I used the following tutorials: [W3School Tutorial 1](http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_lightbulb) and [W3School Tutorial 2](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_onmousedown). I used tutorial 1 to show me how to use an event listener to switch out an image upon a click. Tutorial 2 taught me how to use mousedown and mouseup events to change text color.
##Comments

This was the most difficult assignment thus far, but showed the power event listeners have in making a site functional. Being such a beginner with event listeners, it was difficult to come up with ideas on how to use them, which is why I had to use tutorials. I think once I use them more and see the ways they are used, I will be able to come up with events on my own.

For the counter, I am fully aware that it is not completely right. I tried to make it as close as possible, however.
